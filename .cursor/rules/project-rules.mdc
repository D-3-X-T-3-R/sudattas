# Project Rules

## 1. Generated Files and Entity Regeneration

### 1.1 Never manually edit generated files

Do **not** add, edit, or remove code in generated files. These include (but are not limited to):

- `backend/core_db_entities/src/entity/*.rs` (SeaORM entities)
- Any file that is produced by a codegen or schema-based generator in this project

If the schema or generator output changes, regenerate the files instead of hand-editing them.

### 1.2 Start database and regenerate entities

Use the **start-db** script in `backend`. It stops any running container using an image named `sudattas_*`, starts the database (build and run via `run_database_windows.bat`), then regenerates SeaORM entities (via `core_db_entities/src/entity/generate.ps1`).

**From PowerShell** (from repo root or from `backend`):

```powershell
.\backend\start-db.ps1
```

Or from the backend directory:

```powershell
.\start-db.ps1
```

The script ensures the MySQL container is running with the schema from `backend/database/sql_dump/01_schema.sql` and overwrites entity files in `backend/core_db_entities/src/entity/`.

### 1.3 When you change the schema

- **Always regenerate entities after schema changes** (e.g. after editing `backend/database/sql_dump/01_schema.sql`).
- **Generate before making any other code changes** that depend on the new schema. Order of operations:
  1. Edit the schema file (e.g. `01_schema.sql`).
  2. Run `backend/start-db.ps1` so the database is rebuilt with the new schema and entity files are regenerated.
  3. Then update application code, tests, and migrations that depend on the new entities.

Do not add or edit generated entity code by hand to match schema changes; always regenerate.

## 2. No New SQL Files

Do **not** create any new `.sql` files in this project.

- **Schema changes:** Edit the existing schema file (e.g. `backend/database/sql_dump/01_schema.sql`) instead of adding new migration or schema files.
- **Data or migrations:** Add statements to the appropriate existing SQL file(s) that the project already uses (e.g. `02_data.sql` if it exists for data).

If a change would require a new `.sql` file, incorporate it into an existing SQL file instead.

---

## 3. Testing and Verification

### 3.1 Unit tests when logic is added or updated

Whenever you add or change logic (handlers, procedures, helpers):

- Add **unit tests** that cover:
  - **Success cases**: happy path with valid inputs.
  - **Failure cases**: invalid input, missing data, permission/validation errors.
  - **Edge cases**: empty inputs, boundaries, nil/zero, duplicate keys, concurrent behavior where relevant.

Use the project’s existing patterns (e.g. `handler_*` tests with mock DB, `#[test]` in modules).

### 3.2 Integration tests when logic is added or updated

Whenever you add or change logic that touches the database or cross-service behavior:

- Add **integration tests** (in `backend/core_operations/tests/`) that cover:
  - **Success cases**: full flow against a real DB (with `TEST_DATABASE_URL`).
  - **Failure cases**: bad data, constraint violations, not-found, conflict.
  - **Edge cases**: empty results, limits, idempotency, concurrency if applicable.

Mark tests that need the DB with `#[ignore = "requires TEST_DATABASE_URL and ..."]` and run them with `--ignored`.

### 3.3 Verification steps after making changes

Before considering the task done, run the following from the **backend** directory and ensure all succeed:

**a. Clippy (no warnings)**  
```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

**b. All unit tests**  
```bash
cargo test --all-features -- --skip ignored
```
(Or equivalent so that all non-ignored tests run.)

**c. Integration tests**  
- Ensure the database is running (e.g. run `backend/start-db.ps1` so the MySQL container and schema are up).
- Set the test DB URL, then run all integration tests:
  - **PowerShell:**  
    `$env:TEST_DATABASE_URL = "mysql://root:12345678@127.0.0.1:3306/SUDATTAS"`  
  - **Then:**  
    `cargo test -p core_operations --test '*' --all-features -- --ignored`

**d. Format**  
```bash
cargo fmt
```

### 3.4 Definition of done

The task is **done only when**:

- All of step 3.3 has been run successfully: clippy passes, all unit tests pass, integration tests pass (with DB running and `TEST_DATABASE_URL` set), and `cargo fmt` has been run.

If any of these fail, fix the issues and re-run until everything passes.
